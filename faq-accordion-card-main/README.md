# Frontend Mentor - Accordion Card

### What I learned

#### HTML
```html

```

#### CSS
- buttons and other form elements doesn't inherit styles from HTML because they have default styles assigned by each browser. To override this, add value "inherit" to a CSS property (e.g., font-family) that should be applied to an element (e.g., button)
    ```css
    button {
        font-family: inherit
    }
    ```
- rem
    -- will use it for creating Modular Scale System

- custom radio buttons
    -- 

- SASS veriables and mixins

- SASS partials and @use
```css

```
